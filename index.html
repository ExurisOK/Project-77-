You need to create a folder on your desktop, and then you are free to code whatever you want on visual studio code. Just click the paper looking button on the left once you created the folder on your desktop and then you right click under where it says the name of the folder u gave (on the left) and u create a new file and then u name it to index.html, style.css, and main.jv</h3>
